## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Orange-red (#FF4500) to match the reference image and convey energy and excitement.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) for a modern, sophisticated look. Use a lighter gray (#444444) for the day theme.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFA500) to highlight key interactive elements such as the publish button and special promotions.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, providing a modern and warm aesthetic suitable for both headings and body text.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, outlined icons for the bottom navigation bar to maintain a clean and modern look.
- Implement subtle animations for page transitions and loading states to enhance user experience. Also add parallax animation to some of the page sections.
- Employ a consistent use of a translucent frosted glass effect for top bars and the bottom navigation bar to create a visually appealing and modern interface.
